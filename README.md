# Textract SDK Crack
Renews the free trial for Structurise's Textract SDK.
Textract is a piece of software that reads the text off the screen and uploads it to a text file.
It works with multiple different code languages and has helped me with code projects
I created this simple file that deletes textracts files, giving you another 40 day trial.
Unlimited uses.
